## My Thoughts

F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece continues to resonate nearly a century after its publication. The story of Jay Gatsby's obsessive pursuit of Daisy Buchanan serves as both a romance and a critique of the American Dream.

What strikes me most is Fitzgerald's prose - it's lyrical, evocative, and filled with memorable imagery. The green light at the end of Daisy's dock has become one of literature's most enduring symbols of hope and longing.

Nick Carraway proves to be a fascinating narrator, simultaneously involved in and removed from the drama unfolding around him. His perspective gives us insight into the hollow glamour of the wealthy elite while maintaining enough distance to see the tragedy clearly.

## Key Takeaways

- The American Dream can become corrupted by materialism and the pursuit of wealth for its own sake
- The past cannot be repeated, no matter how desperately we wish to recapture it
- Class divisions in America are more rigid than we like to believe
- Wealth and privilege often come with moral bankruptcy

## Memorable Quotes

> "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."

> "I hope she'll be a fool—that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."

> "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us."

## Would I Recommend?

Absolutely. This is essential American literature that rewards multiple readings. Each time I return to it, I discover new layers and nuances. Perfect for anyone interested in the Jazz Age, the nature of dreams and disillusionment, or simply beautiful prose.
